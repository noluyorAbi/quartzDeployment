# Modules

## Info Modules
- [[FSK|FSK (Formale Sprachen und Komplexität) ]] (in work)
- [[RNVS|RNVS (Rechnernetze und Verteilte Systeme)]] (in work)
- [[IT-Kompetenz]]
- [[Bachelorseminar-Software Security]] (in work)

## Statistic Modules

- [[FortStaSoft]]
- [[BaySta]]

### Selectable Modules for Statistics

I am currently unsure which of the bottom four modules I will ultimately choose. They are likely to be updated in the first few weeks of the 4th semester, after which three of them will become deprecated and I will choose one:

- [[BaySta|Einführung in die Bayes-Statistik]] (BaysSta got selected)
- [[LiMo]] 
- [[I2ML]]
- [[Einführung in Python]] 

These updates are intended to provide the most current and relevant content. I will make my decision based on these updates and the modules' relevance to my future studies.
