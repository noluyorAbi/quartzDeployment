# Modules

## Info Modules

- [[RNVS|Rechnernetze und Verteilte Systeme (RNVS)]] (in work)

- [[Bachelorseminar-Software Security]] (in work)

### Selectable Modules for Statistics

I am currently unsure which of the bottom four modules I will ultimately choose. They are likely to be updated in the first few weeks of the 4th semester, after which three of them will become deprecated and I will choose one:

- [[Einf체hrung in die Bayes-Statistik]] (in work)
- [[LiMo-1VL-15-04-24]] (in work)
- [[Einf체hrung in das maschinelle Lernen]] (in work)
- [[Einf체hrung in Python]] (in work)

These updates are intended to provide the most current and relevant content. I will make my decision based on these updates and the modules' relevance to my future studies.
