# Modules

## Info Modules

- [[Rechnernetze und Verteilte Systeme]] (in work)

- [[Bachelorseminar-Software Security]] (in work)

## Statistic Modules

### Selectable Modules for Statistics

I am currently unsure which of the bottom four modules I will ultimately choose. They are likely to be updated in the first few weeks of the 4th semester, after which three of them will become deprecated and I will choose one:

- [[Einführung in die Bayes-Statistik]] (in work)
- [[Einführung in die linearen statistischen Modellierung]] (in work)
- [[Einführung in das maschinelle Lernen]] (in work)
- [[Einführung in Python]] (in work)

These updates are intended to provide the most current and relevant content. I will make my decision based on these updates and the modules' relevance to my future studies.
