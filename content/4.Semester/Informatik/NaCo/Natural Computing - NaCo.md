# Natural Computing - Index

Welcome to the Natural Computing index page. This serves as a directory to key topics and resources I've compiled while preparing for my Natural Computing exam.

> Please note that this page is not heavily filled with information, as I decided to prioritize this topic just one week before the exam. Due to the limited time, I had to quickly gather and learn the material, which resulted in less detailed content than I would have liked.

## [[Elitist vs Greedy]]

A comparison of two important concepts in optimization algorithms.

## [[Mock Exam - KnowHow]]

Key insights and knowledge extracted from mock exams for quick review.

## [[Cheatsheet - NaCo]]

A condensed cheatsheet of essential terms and concepts in Natural Computing.
