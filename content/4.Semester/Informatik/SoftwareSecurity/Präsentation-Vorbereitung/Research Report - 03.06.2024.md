# Bibliography Recommendation Report: JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) have become a cornerstone in modern web security, particularly in the realms of authentication and authorization. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of various resources that can contribute to understanding JWTs, their applications, security best practices, and potential vulnerabilities. Each source is evaluated based on its relevance, reliability, and significance to the topic.
